## My neo neovim config X)

Moving to NixOs, I spent some time reconfiguring nvim.

Deeper in lua learning, I optimizated many many codes(e.g. using fp way, tables to contain configs and
metatables to abstract key-mode and key-opt...).

What's more, I finally decided to replace the lsp plugin, and switched from coc to nvim-lsp.

Also replaced some other plugins, and I dont want to list them all.

Thats all, Im quite satisfied with new configs at the moment :).
